Pure functions:
	-have no hidden inputs
	-have no hidden outputs
	-do not execute other side effects

	-are called referentially transpparent: 
	 they return the same result everytime they're called
	 with the same visible parameter
	-they can be treated as data

We have to mutate things as less as possible.
Functional programming - functions are trated as data

CODE NOTES: 
	-when using functionalPlus library you have to remove 
	 a couple of lines from result.hpp file.
	-to add an include folder to the project: 
		Project -> properties -> C/C++ -> general -> Additional include directories
