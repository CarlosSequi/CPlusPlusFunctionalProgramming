Pure functions:
	-have no hidden inputs
	-have no hidden outputs
	-do not execute other side effects

	-are called referentially transpparent: 
	 they return the same result everytime they're called
	 with the same visible parameter
	-they can be treated as data

We have to mutate things as less as possible.
Functional programming - functions are trated as data

CODE NOTES (Visual Studio 2019): 
	-when using functionalPlus library you have to remove 
	 a couple of lines from result.hpp file.
	-to add an include folder to the project: 
		Project -> properties -> C/C++ -> general -> Additional include directories
		set it to: "$(SolutionDir)Dependencias/include"

DRY principle = Don't Repeat Yourself

Class 1.3 : types of data in functional programming

int x
x : Int;

vector<int> xs;
xs: [Int];

pair<int, float> p;
p : (Int, Float);

map<Key, Value> dict;
dict : Map Key Value;

int foo(string)
foo : String -> Int

ContainerIn transform(F function, const ContainerOut& xs);
transform : ((a->b), [a]) -> [b]

// this is a variation of the use of templates just
// for restrict the use of std functions:
std::function<void(int)> f; // f is an object of type "function"
							// to which it can be assigned any function
							// which receives an int and returns void.

Container keep_if(F function, const Container & xs);
keep_if : ((a -> Bool), [a]) -> [a]

Here we can search for functions using queries in functional programming
notation or in classic c++ notation

class 10:

arity: number of parameters a function takes
partial application: process of decreasing the arity
currying: transformation of a several arguments function in a 
		  single argument function
